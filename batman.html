  <p>After witnessing his parents' murder on the streets of Gotham City as a young boy, a Millionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne, (Michael Keaton) uses his mental and physical capabilities to become a masked vigilante; a mysterious guise known as "The Bat Man".

Among the gangs, violence, and police corruption emerges a greater threat, a homicidal maniac known as "The Joker" (Jack Nicholson). Is The Joker just another criminal on Batman's "Wanted" List, or is there a deeper connection to be unveiled? With the help of reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and his loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough), Bruce Wayne must use his detective skills to uncover the mystery behind The Joker's reign of terror. One of the highest grossing films of 1989, Tim Burton's "Batman" became a template for all big-budget comic-book films.</p>
